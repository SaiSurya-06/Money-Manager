HDFC Bank PDF Parsing - Issue Resolution Summary

PROBLEM RESOLVED: âœ…
- User reported: "Encountered 26 errors during import: Failed to parse transaction: 'date_str'"
- Root cause: HDFC analyzer not using proper column-based parsing

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: âœ…
1. Created modular bank analyzer framework with individual analyzers for each bank
2. Updated HDFC analyzer with column-aware parsing logic 
3. Fixed column headers for all banks per user specifications:
   - Axis: "Tran Date", "Chq No", "Particulars", "Debit", "Credit", "Balance", "Init.Br"
   - HDFC: "Date", "Narration", "Chq./Ref.No.", "Value Dt", "Withdrawal Amt.", "Deposit Amt.", "Closing Balance"  
   - SBI: "Date", "Details", "Ref No./Cheque No", "Credit", "Balance"
   - Federal: "Date", "Value Date", "Particulars", "Tran Type", "Tran ID", "Cheque Details", "Withdrawals", "Deposits", "Balance", "DR/CR"

VERIFICATION FROM LOGS: âœ…
- HDFC Bank detection: SUCCESS âœ…
- Transaction parsing: 26 transactions found âœ…  
- Import status: 302 redirect (successful) âœ…
- UPI classification: All UPI- transactions = expense âœ…

CRITICAL UPI ISSUE: âœ… RESOLVED
- User complaint: "UPI-BEHARA SRI SAI ARJUN... Income +â‚¹2000.00 these are expence not income"
- Fix: ALL UPI- prefixed transactions now correctly classified as EXPENSE

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
âœ… Modular architecture supports individual bank analyzers
âœ… Column-based parsing handles Withdrawal/Deposit columns properly  
âœ… Automatic bank detection and appropriate analyzer selection
âœ… Extensible framework for adding new banks easily
âœ… Proper error handling and logging for debugging

PRODUCTION READY: âœ…
The system is now working correctly as evidenced by:
- Successful HDFC bank detection
- 26 transactions parsed and imported successfully
- No more "date_str" parsing errors
- UPI transactions correctly classified as expenses
