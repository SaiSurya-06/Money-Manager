## 📊 P&L CALCULATION LOGIC

### **Individual Holdings:**
```python
current_value = quantity × current_price
total_cost = quantity × average_cost  
gain_loss = current_value - total_cost
gain_loss_percentage = (gain_loss / total_cost) × 100
```

### **Portfolio Totals:**
```python
portfolio_value = sum(all_holding_current_values)
total_invested = sum(all_holding_costs)
total_gain_loss = portfolio_value - total_invested
return_percentage = (total_gain_loss / total_invested) × 100
```

### **Transaction Impact:**
- **Buy:** Updates average cost and increases quantity
- **Sell:** Realizes gains/losses, reduces quantity
- **Dividend:** Records income without affecting holdings
